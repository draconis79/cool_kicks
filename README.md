# Cool Kicks

<br>

Cool Kicks is a sneaker app where users can check out the editor's pick, release date as well as post their sneakers to the community. Sneakers get announced constantly. So much so that keeping up with it is like a full-time job. For those who want to keep tabs on what is going on in the community, there is no better place than here.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js/Express/EJS
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- CSS/Bootstrap
- HTML
- Atom for text-editing

<br>

## Approach

The main page encourages the user to post their own sneaker. The top picks page shows all the sneakers curated by the editor and sneakers created by the users. The show page allows the user to edit and delete their post.

<br>

## Technical Challenges

- I successfully created login and user accounts but had to abandon the code after I struggled getting my routes working.
- Styling with CSS/Bootstrap is really fun but I ran into alignment and column issues.
- I had syntax errors which took a long time to resolve but luckily I had fresh pair of eyes from my classmates.

<br>

## Future Improvements

- Add user comment capability
- Users can rate sneakers
- Users can like a post
- Build on the theme with CSS/Bootstrap
- Complete login/logout
- Create a map that shows users where to get the sneakers
